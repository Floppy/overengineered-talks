Astrophysics and music were clearly the best foundations for being an entrepreneur, converting a century-old cargo ship into a home, and trying to tackle climate change. Gavin will tell stories about dealing with extreme impostor syndrome, projects hatched through complete ignorance, and list at least ten things that might happen if you willfully ignore everyone's expectations.

*AND/OR* 

Obviously the best use of a shallow understanding of cosmology and electronic music was to build a universe made out of sound. Gavin will describe why and how he's been mashing up theories of general relativity with sound to create a 'music of the hypersphere', and then live demo sonons (the sonic equivalent of photons) in a mathematically consistent soniverse. And try and play a radio data cube of a galaxy without the aid of a gravitational safety net.
