In this talk Peter will talk about some ridiculous projects he worked on at unnamed clients in unnamed countries. Examples include:

i) a world-leading rollout of VoIP telephony that didn't work
ii) a network operations centre to monitor the VoIP telephony service that cost millions but didn't actually monitor a service received by millions of people
iii) a television service that succeeded when it got as few customers as possible

He hopes that attendees will learn that over-engineering can be endemic but that it can also be funny.
