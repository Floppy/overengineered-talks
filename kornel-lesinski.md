If you prefer coding in PHP, but you're jelous of JavaScript's elaborate build process tooling, then I've got something for you! Now, with just one line of config (and 30,000-line JavaScript compiler toolkit), you can write your front-end applications in PHP. Run run and debug PHP code in the browser or in Node.js.

I can't explain why, but I can explain how I've built `babel-preset-php` that transpiles PHP synatx to JavaScript. What are the difficulties in writing compilers. Quirks of PHP and JS syntax. What font is used in the PHP logo.
