# OverEngineered 2017: Talks

This repository contains talk proposals for the OverEngineered 2017 conference.

To submit a talk, copy `example.yml`, fill in the details, and send a pull request.

## How is this overengineered?

1. You have to specify the duration in ISO8601
2. Later on we'll include it as a submodule in the main website and if that's not overengineering it, I don't know what is.
